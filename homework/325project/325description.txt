                 === Birder Database ===

This database was set up to be used for a birding service
in which users can attend or create events, report their 
bird sightings, and have their own account which contains
other birding related information.

-------

The database is made up six tables; birder, location, bird,
sighting, event, and birder_attending_event

* Birder contains an id, username, favorite bird,
  and favorite location

* Location contains an id, and location name

* Bird contains an id, and a bird name

* Sighting contains an id, bird id, birder id, location id
  and number of birds sighted.

* Event contains an id, birder id (as a singular host id),
  event date, and event title.

* Birder_attending_event is used to connect many 
  birders to a single event

-------

I think this could be used to gather people to participate
in research projects that need a wide area of data collection
which otherwise be impossible or difficult for small groups
of researchers.
